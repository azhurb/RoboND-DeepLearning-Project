## Introduction

The project task is to locate and follow a moving target. 
This can be done by analyzing individual camera frames coming from a front-facing camera on the drone. 
Then we need to classify each pixel of each frame using a fully convolutional neural network.

## Data Collection

Perhaps one of the most important tasks when working with a neural network is the collection and preparation of data.
A simple data set was provided in the project. Also given instructions how to collect additional data using a simulator and data collection best practices.

## Network Architecture

Since our task is to obtain information about the location of the hero we will use Fully Convolutional Neural Network. In this network, all layers are convolutional layers. Fully connected layers are good for image classification tasks, but they do not preserve spatial information.  
The model will consist from:  
* Two encoder layers
* 1x1 convolution
* Two decoder layers
* Skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers

### Encoder

The Encoder part extracts features from the image. A deeper encoder, more complex shapes that it can extract.
We will use Separable Convolutions. This is a technique that reduces the number of parameters needed, thus increasing efficiency for the encoder network.

```python
def encoder_block(input_layer, filters, strides):
    
    # Create a separable convolution layer using the separable_conv2d_batchnorm() function.
    output_layer = separable_conv2d_batchnorm(input_layer, filters, strides)
    
    return output_layer
```

### 1x1 Convolution

The output of a convolutional layer is a 4-dimensional tensor. But if we want to use fully connected layer we need to flatten it into a 2-dimensional tensor. This leads to a loss of spatial information because no information about the location of the pixels is preserved. We can avoid that by using 1x1 convolution.

### Decoder

The Decoder part upscale Encoder output back to the input image dimensions. In addition, each layer of the Decoder contains a skip connection, to the corresponding encoder layer. Skip connection connects the output of one layer to the input of the other. As a result, the network is able to make more precise segmentation decision.

```python
def decoder_block(small_ip_layer, large_ip_layer, filters):
    
    # Upsample the small input layer using the bilinear_upsample() function.
    up_small_ip_layer = bilinear_upsample(small_ip_layer)
    
    # Concatenate the upsampled and large input layers using layers.concatenate
    concat_layer = layers.concatenate([up_small_ip_layer, large_ip_layer])
    
    # Add some number of separable convolution layers
    output_layer = separable_conv2d_batchnorm(concat_layer, filters)
    
    return output_layer
```

## Training

Because our task is computationally demanding and we have big training set then it is more rational to use GPU for training.
I already have a [configured](https://medium.com/google-cloud/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-gpu-on-google-cloud-d44f57d22dbd) Compute Engine with NVIDIA Tesla K80 in Google Cloud so I decided to use it.  
After some time playing with hyperparameters I stopped at the following:  
```
learning_rate = 0.01
batch_size = 128
num_epochs = 20
```

These hyperparameters and the network architecture helped to achieve the final score `0.42`, which is enough for submission.

## Future Enhancements

As usual in Deep Learning there are many ways to improve the results.  
For the task of this project and I see the following ways to improve:  
1. Use more layers in Decoder and Encoder.
2. Use bigger dataset for example using data augmentation.
3. Try to reduce learning rate because validation loss curve is not optimal.
4. Try different optimizers for example Nadam.
