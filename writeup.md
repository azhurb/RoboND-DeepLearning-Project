## Introduction

The project task is to locate and follow a moving target. 
This can be done by analyzing individual camera frames coming from a front-facing camera on the drone. 
Then we need to classify each pixel of each frame using a fully convolutional neural network.

## Data Collection

Perhaps one of the most important tasks when working with a neural network is the collection and preparation of data.
A simple data set was provided in the project. Also given instructions how to collect additional data using a simulator and data collection best practices.
